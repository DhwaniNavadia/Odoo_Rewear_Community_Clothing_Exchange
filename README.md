# 👕 ReWear – Community Clothing Exchange

> A modern, minimal, and classy web application with an interactive design and responsive layout.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

- Develop ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing
through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The goal is to promote sustainable
fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging users to reuse wearable garments instead of
discarding them.
